# DIT113MqttWorkshop
## Purpose
The goal of the workshop is to give student practical knowledge and deeper understanding on how to work with MQTT. Ensuring that they can get familiar with how to create MQTT topics and use them while publishing and subscribing. Moreover, the students gain a general understanding of how to handle incomming messages from the broker. 

## Description
The Android app has a basic voice recognition that identifies different color commands which are then send to the Wio Terminal using MQTT.

## Setup Guide
:warning: *Doesn't work with iPhone's shared WiFi or eduroam*

| Description | Command/Clarification |
|-------|---|
|Create a header file. [See instructions](https://github.com/Quinstedt/DIT113MqttWorkshop/wiki/How-to-create-a-header-file-for-your-personal-data)| `#define SSID "<WiFi name>" `<br>  `#define PASSWORD "<the WiFi password>" ` <br>  `#define my_IPv4 "<ipv4>"`|
| To find your IP for my_IPv4, open a terminal run the command and select the IP "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi: IPv4 Address"  | Windows: `ipconfig `<br> MacOS: `/sbin/ifconfig` |
| Go to the mosquitto folder and open mosquitto.config file in your computer, below "General configuration" add: | `listener 1883 0.0.0.0 ` <br> `allow_anonymous true` |
| Open terminal and navigate to mosquitto root folder | Windows: `mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf -v `<br> MacOS: `brew services start mosquitto` |
| In Android Studio, go to Device manager and download an emulator | Use API 30 or API 31. <br> [How to download an Emulator?](https://github.com/Quinstedt/DIT113MqttWorkshop/wiki/Set-up-an-Emulator) |
| Activate the microphone | Open *Extended Controls* and activate the microphone settings <br><br> ![ezgif com-video-to-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90027419/228104899-651069f6-8368-41f3-9a11-74f43ccd4cfb.gif) |

## Common Errors

# Tasks
Remember to create different issues, use labels and use feature branches. The more you practice the better you get at it. :smile:<br>
A few implementation are missing and your job is to implement them, they are mark with a **TODO** in the code. <br>

- [ ] Add the header file to gitignore. You dont want your personal data out.

## Android studio
**:bangbang::warning: NOTE:** You don't need to understand how Android Studio or the voice recognition works, you should focus on understanding the MQTT connection. I have added comments and additional documentation for those that may be interested. We will cover Android Studio during the Android Studio lecture. 
<br>Before moving to the implementation of the missing parts in the past, start with the first task here. That will provide you a better understanding of the code that you need to use in Android Studio.

- [ ] Create a class diagram for the Android class in "com.quinstedt.speechtotext" folder. <br>	*You should only include the 4 classes in that folder*
- [ ] Add a picture to the README.md
- [ ] BrokerConnection class - define a subscription topic and subscribe to the connection message
- [ ] MainActivity class - define a publish topic for the color commands and publish the color command

## Arduino IDE/Wio Terminal
- [ ] Add the topics for publish and subscribe
- [ ] Complete the implemention of the setColorAndPrintMessage(String message) function, for the color *red*, *black* and *blue* this should be done by using the incomming messages.

## Introducing a new color with its own topic
*:bangbang::no_entry: IMPORTANT:* Don't do this task before completing the previous task.<br>
Now that you can change the color of your Wio terminal using the voice commands in your Android App :sunglasses::thumbsup:, we are going to introduce at least one more color.
The new color MUST have its own topic (*It cannot be the exact same topic as you use for the previous colors*).
- [ ] Add the new color in the Colors enum class
- [ ] Refactor the publishColor method so that it now can send the previous colors command AND the new color using it's own topic.
- [ ] Refactor the callback function in the your Arduino code, so that it can handle the two different topics for the changes in the display color.

## Final README update
- [ ] Create a simple digram that shows the MQTT communication between components. <br> *Clarification: create a diagram that shows all three components and the topic that they subscribe and publish to.* 
- [ ] Add a picture to the README
